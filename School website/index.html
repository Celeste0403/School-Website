                every day.” Year 6 <br><br>


                “On my first day at SOU, I was paired up with another girl in my class. She had to show me around and
                introduce me to other students. We are now the best of friends! I love coming to school and playing

                residential trip this year to Yangshuo. It was great being away from home with all of my friends. We
                learnt how to be independent, which was cool.” Year 6 <br><br>

                “We learnt all about chocolate, it was yummy! It was fun to try lots of chocolate and learn how to make
                it. I want to make chocolate when I am big.” Year 1

                “SOU has a very friendly atmosphere to it. It has an environment that stimulates people to learn new
                things. The one thing that stands out at SOU is that the school has a unique “everyone-knows-everyone”
                feel. That has never changed throughout my 6 years at school.” Year 13

                difficult to understand what was going on in lessons. However, with English lessons and encouragement
                from both teachers and other students, I persevered and saw dramatic improvements. I am now really
                confident with my English ability and have immersed myself into many activities within school because of
                this.” Year 10.</p>
